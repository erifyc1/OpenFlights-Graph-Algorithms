# Communication

## Team meetings: 

- Our team will meet once a week every Monday from 7-8PM on discord. We will be rather flexible on this time and date though only guaranteeing one meeting a week. We will switch notetakers every week starting with aelys2. These notes will be saved in a Google Doc Labeled with the date. The DEVELOPMENT LOG entry, which is approved by the team will be written by the notetaker unless they notify the group that they will be unable to beforehand.

## Assistance: 

- We will communicate primarily through Discord. We will commit to responding before 11:00 PM the day the message was sent with the exception of emergencies.

## Respect: 

- The notetaker will be the "project lead" for the weekly meeting. The team lead will make sure that everyone has the chance to voice their opinions on implementation and that discourse is not one sided. All decisions will be decided by a majority vote.
 
# Collaboration

## Work Distribution:

- We will work to distribute the work evenly by estimating the amount of work per deliverable and then assigning people with deliverables with a sum of equal amounts of work. People can first volunteer to choose their deliverable, and then we will evenly distribute the remaining deliverables. We will work individually on deliverables for the most part, however, we will offer assistance to eachother should there be any issues.

## Time Commitment:

- Each member is expected to work from 2-6 hours per week. If the amont of work required of one member happens to increase beyond 6 hours, we will split the extra work evenly, with every member being responsible for the increase, rather than the individual who initially had it as their work.

## Conflict Resolution

- To resolve a disagreement, talk to the other person, then talk as a group, then if the behavior doesnâ€™t change we will talk to an instructor. If it is truly an even split between all members, we will settle using bullet chess.
