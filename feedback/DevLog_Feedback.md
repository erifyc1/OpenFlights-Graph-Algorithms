I like that you have included a detailed breakdown of your goals, tasks, and problems. Although you may not have been able to accomplish everything desired for the past week, it seems that you have clear ideas to move forward with.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

### Comments:
It looks like your group has made some good progress so far. In preparation for the mid-project check-in meeting, don't forget to write test cases for any algorithms you implement and your graph data structure. I would recommend focusing on finishing BFS before the meeting, and making sure your dataset parsing works.

### Comments:
The weekend does count as part of the week, so it's not an issue if you have other commitments during the weekdays. So far I would say your group is on track to finish, and if you complete BFS before the meeting that would be great. At the very least, make sure your data parsing and correction is complete for full points on the testing component of the project meeting. Looking forward to meeting with your group later this week.

### Comments:
I think your group has made good progress on the project, as we had discussed during the check-in meeting. The remaining algorithms to be implemented hopefully shouldn't be too difficult for your group to complete.
