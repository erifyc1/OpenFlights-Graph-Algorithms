## Week 1

### Goals
- This week we first had planned to find the data set. This was accomplished and can be found in the routes.csv file.
- We had also planned on finishing code to ingest the data and store it. This was not accomplished this week.
### Member Specific Tasks
- Andrew (me) was supposed to write majority of the code for data ingestion.
- Jacob was supposed to create the make file
- Evan was not given any specific goal.
- NOTE: Overall the goal for this week was just setting up a method to ingest the code and finding the data. So, there was not much seperation of tasks planned out ahead of time.
### Problems
- We all seemed to have schedules that did not align that well this week specifically. 
- We spent much of our time working on the MP for this week, which took time away from the project. (this was in order to make next week better)
- We also failed to create an in-depth plan of file layouts and class responsibilities.
### NEXT WEEK
- Next week, we plan to finish data ingestion into our map (This involves setting up Airport and DataHandler classes). We also hope to begin converting our data into a graph and start working on our BFS traversal.

## Week 2
### Goals
- This week we planned to create the basic structure of classes (Airport and DataHandler) we were going to use as well as working on reading in data. This data would be stored in the map data structure we previously mentioned.
- Due to the large quantity of data, we made it our goal this week to export our map data structure into a simplified file that can be read more quickly. (compressed.txt)
-
### Member Specific Tasks
- Andrew set up the Airport and DataHandler classes, as well as incorportating which airline is operating which flights into the data. 
- Jacob (me) created the majority of the data ingestion, including saving the imported data to compressed.txt for easy retrieval. This was extensively documented in comments throughout the code and header files.
- Evan was working on exporting the map data structure into an adjacency matrix. This would be used in PageRank later down the line.
### Problems
- We spent some amount of time working on the MP for this week, which took time away from the project. The time lost was minimal compared to last week, but we hope that, starting next week, we can fully dedicate our CS225 work time on the project. 
- We had a bit of trouble with the MakeFile and .gitignore (but this is now fixed).
### NEXT WEEK
- We also hope to begin converting our data into a graph.
- We hope to mostly, if not completely finish our BFS traversal.
- We hope to get started on PageRank.
