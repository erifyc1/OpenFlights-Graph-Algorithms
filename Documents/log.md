## Week 1
#### Goals
- This week we first had planned to find the data set. This was accomplished and can be found in the routes.csv file.
- We had also planned on finishing code to ingest the data and store it. This was not accomplished this week.
### Member Specific Tasks
- Andrew (me) was supposed to write majority of the code for data ingestion.
- Jacob was supposed to create the make file
- Evan was not given any specific goal.
- NOTE: Overall the goal for this week was just setting up a method to ingest the code and finding the data. So, there was not much seperation of tasks planned out ahead of time.
### Problems
- We all seemed to have schedules that did not align that well this week specifically.
- We also failed to create an in-depth plan of file layouts and class responsibilities.
### NEXT WEEK
- Next week, we plan to finish data ingestion into our map (This involves setting up Airport and DataHandler classes). We also hope to begin converting our data into a graph and start working on our BFS traversal.
